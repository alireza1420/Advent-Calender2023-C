-This is the description for the solution of day1_part1 of the advent calendar set

by creating a header file and putting the puzzle inputs in an array, we can access each row of data and follow that with 
a set of computations that will be covered in this document

1) first a variable with the name of total will be assigned the value of 00
2) we will loop through each element and try to find the digits on each string, this will be done using getEachLineValue function
3)the firstNumb and lastNumb are initializing a null character. We will use the first to assign the first accord digit number and the last will be the last digit in the string
4) the *p is pointing to the line that we are looping through (current line) and at the time it is initialized, its value is the [0] character in the string, however, by applying p++, it will move toward the end of the string
5) we check if the current character is a digit or not
6) if it is a digit, we will assign it to the firstNumb and lastN 
7) the last numb also will be assigned the same value, this is because of a case that we only have one digit in the entire string
8)however, if a digit is found, we will update the lastNumb
9)then by (firstNumb - '0') * 10 + (lastNumb - '0'), we will turn a char into integer
10) the value should be added to the total which we assigned 0 in the begining, this value will be updated as we loop through each string
11) finally, we will return the total value which is the sum of all the numbers in our input
