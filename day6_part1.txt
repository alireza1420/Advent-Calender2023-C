-This is the description for the solution of day6_part1 of the advent calendar set

1) In this problem we are asked to find the amount of times that we can break the record
2) I decided to make 2 arrays, one for the time and one for the distance that my boat has to reach
3)I loop through the number of races
4) for each race, I have to do the required calculations 
5) numberOfWins, determines the number of times my boat can beat the record
6) for the calculation, each time we loop through the race time, we increase the holding time and decrease the remaining time 
7) for instance 40*0, 39*1, 38*2 ....
8) is my travel destination is greater than the record, I count it a win 
9) since we are asked to return the multiplication of all the number of times we could beat the race, I multiply them by the sum
10) sum is my answer;
