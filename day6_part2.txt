-This is the description for the solution of day6_part2 of the advent calendar set

1) this problem is a variation of our previous problem which requires us to work with bigger integer numbers
2) this time, we dont have more than one race.
3) However, in order for our numbers not to overflow, we need to use long long data type to store our integer
4) when we loop through the time itself, we will keep the speed as the amount of time we hold the button.
5) for the calculation, each time we loop through the race time, we increase the holding time and decrease the remaining time 
6) as muy character, puts his hand on the bottom, the remaining race time, decreases, which is shown on the variable remaining.
7) finally, my distance traveled is the multiplication of speed*remaining;
8) If it is greater than the record, I add one to the winingNumb
